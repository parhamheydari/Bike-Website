<p class="aboutpara"> Rent a Bike was founded by Parham Heydari in early 2021. Our company offers services no one else does. If you are going on a holiday
    and don't have the accessories to transport your rented bicycle then you can ask us where and when you would like your bikes to be delivered. 
    
    <br><br> We offer world wide shipping
    and support so if you are far from home and your bicycle breaks down, our maintenance team is on the phone 24/7. For years we have been mastering the art of Bicycle Ecommerce, 
    and after countless hours of research we have realised that many people do not want to purchase a bike thus making us come up with the idea of renting a bike. 
    <br><br>
    If the bike you rent costs over £500 then shipping will be on us! If you also don't want to rent it for a month then you can rent it for a shorter amount of time even a day 
    for those who do bicycle marathons. If you don't like your bike or can't fix the issues with our maintenance team then don't worry, we will replace it for you free of charge!
    <br><br>
    If you have any problems you can always contact us via <a href="mailto:Parhey10@gmail.com"> Email</a> or you give us a <a href="tel:07930202662"> Call</a>. Telephone lines are open 24/7
    so you don't have to worry about calling us from different timezones. If you are unable to get any reception or/and have problems with your email then you can head over to <a href="Contact.html">Contact Us</a>
    and fill out the form, we promise to reply within 2-4 hours. If you would like to  subscribe to our newsletter program to receive weekly deals please enter your email address down below.
    <br><br>

    Thank you for chosing Rent a Bike, I hope that in the future we will meet or exceed your expectations.
